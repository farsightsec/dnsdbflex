dnsdbflex is a pure C99 program that accesses passive DNS database systems such as:
	* the DNSDB Flex API server at Farsight Security

An API key is required for operation.

The dnsdbflex executable has the following dependencies:

Dependencies:
	jansson (2.5 or later)
	libcurl (7.28 or later)
	modern compiler (clang or GCC)

On Linux (Debian 8):
	apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
	apt-get install libjansson-dev

On Linux (CentOS 6):
	# Based on PHP instructions for installing libcurl...
	wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	tar xvzf curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	cd curl-7.28.1/
	./configure --with-libssh2 --enable-ares=/usr/local/ --enable-ipv6
	make
	make install

	# lib jansson
	wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	tar -xpzf jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	cd jansson-2.5
	./configure
	make
	make install

	echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	ldconfig

On FreeBSD 10:
	pkg install curl jansson

On OSX:
	brew install jansson

Getting Started
	Add the API key to ~/.dnsdb-query.conf in the below given format,
	APIKEY="YOURAPIKEYHERE"

	If you don't have an API key, you may qualify for a free one:

The three optional filter scripts require the "jq" command-line processor:
  filter_rdata_json_to_csv.sh
  filter_rrnames_json_to_csv.sh
  filter_rdata_raw_json_to_batch.sh

jq is available in source from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

    On Linux (Debian 8 and higher):
            apt-get install jq

    On OSX:
            brew install jq

    On FreeBSD 10:
            pkg install jq

All three scripts take dnsdbflex json output as input and produce
different outputs.

filter_rdata_json_to_csv.sh

        Takes JSON produced by `dnsdbflex -s rdata` and produces CSV
        output.

filter_rrnames_json_to_csv.sh

        Takes JSON produced by `dnsdbflex -s rrnames` and produces CSV
        output.

filter_rdata_raw_json_to_batch.sh

        Takes JSON produced by `dnsdbflex -s rdata` and produces
        dnsdbq batch file input data.  This is useful if dnsdbflex was
        run in -j mode, but you decide you want output from -F more.
